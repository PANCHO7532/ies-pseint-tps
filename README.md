## What is this
PSeInt and C++ scripts that I had to make for some assignment at my school

## What's PSeInt (required for opening and testing .psc files)
Check it out by clicking [here](https://pseint.sourceforge.net/)

In short, spanish pseudolanguage for teaching newbies how to code, you have to install it if you want to test anything in here.

## What's C++ (required for testing .cpp files)
Low-level programming language, check out more info in [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++)

You'll also need a compiler and IDE, I've made all the .cpp files on CodeBlocks which you can download from [here](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/) in order to get the *same* experience and behavior that I had, you can also compile them manually with *any* compiler, I didn't use anything fancy.

### Is there something useful in here?
